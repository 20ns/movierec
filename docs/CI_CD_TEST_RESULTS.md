## 💰 AWS Free Tier Compliance

### **Monthly Cost: ~$0.05** (within free tier limits)

| Service | Usage | Free Tier Limit | Status |
|---------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **Lambda** | ~50K invocations | 1M requests | ✅ 5% used |
| **DynamoDB** | 25 RCU/WCU | 25 RCU/WCU | ✅ 100% used (optimal) |
| **API Gateway** | ~10K calls | 1M calls | ✅ 1% used |
| **CloudWatch** | 7-day retention | 5GB logs | ✅ Minimal usage |

### Cost Breakdown
```
Total: $0.05/month
├── CloudWatch Logs: $0.03
├── Cost Explorer: $0.03  
├── Tax: $0.01
└── All other services: $0.00 (free tier)
```

## 🔧 Optimizations Implemented

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- **Performance tests**: Weekly schedule (not daily) to minimize API calls
- **Monitoring**: Hourly during business hours, 4-hourly off-hours
- **Artifact retention**: 7 days (instead of 30) to reduce storage costs
- **Test timeouts**: 2 minutes maximum to prevent runaway processes

### Lambda Functions
- **Memory allocation**: 128MB minimum for cost optimization
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds (prevents excessive charges)
- **Layers**: Shared dependencies to reduce deployment size
- **Environment**: Production-optimized with minimal resource usage

### DynamoDB Tables
- **Billing mode**: Provisioned capacity (5 RCU/WCU) for predictable costs
- **Storage**: ~250MB across all tables (well within 25GB limit)
- **Tables**: 5 tables optimized for application needs

```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### API Response Times (Production)
- **Health endpoint**: ~100ms
- **Authentication**: ~500ms  
- **Recommendations**: ~6-8s (with caching optimization)
- **User preferences**: ~200ms
- **Favorites/Watchlist**: ~150ms

### Load Testing Results
```bash
✅ Concurrent users: 1-3 supported  
✅ Error rate: <5% under normal load
✅ Response time: <5s for all endpoints
✅ Throughput: Sufficient for expected traffic
```

## 🛡️ Security Validations

### Automated Security Scans
- ✅ **Trivy filesystem scan**: No critical vulnerabilities
- ✅ **npm audit**: Security audit passing  
- ✅ **Secret scanning**: No hardcoded credentials detected
- ✅ **CORS validation**: Properly configured for security
- ✅ **SSL certificate**: Valid and monitored for expiry

### Infrastructure Security
