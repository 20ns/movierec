## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd movierec
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your AWS Cognito, API Gateway, and TMDB API keys:
    ```plaintext
    REACT_APP_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=your_user_pool_id
    REACT_APP_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
    REACT_APP_API_GATEWAY_INVOKE_URL=your_api_gateway_url
    REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
    REACT_APP_REDIRECT_SIGN_IN=http://localhost:8080/ # Or your dev URL
    REACT_APP_REDIRECT_SIGN_OUT=http://localhost:8080/ # Or your dev URL
    ```
    *(Note: You might need to configure AWS Amplify CLI and set up the backend resources if deploying from scratch)*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified by Webpack Dev Server).

## üì¶ Build for Production
