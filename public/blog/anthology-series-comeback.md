In an age of sprawling cinematic universes and multi-season character arcs, there's a refreshing appeal to the anthology series. Offering self-contained stories within each episode or season, these shows provide diverse narratives, creative freedom for filmmakers, and a lower commitment for viewers. From mind-bending sci-fi to chilling horror and sharp social satire, anthology series are experiencing a major resurgence. Here are a few standout examples proving that sometimes, shorter storytelling packs the biggest punch.
