Christopher Nolan's heist thriller set within the architecture of the mind is a modern classic of the genre. Following a team that enters people's dreams to steal information or plant ideas, *Inception* is a layered, complex narrative that famously leaves audiences debating its final moments. Its exploration of dreams, reality, and memory is both thrilling and thought-provoking.

## 2. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)

What if you could erase painful memories? This melancholic sci-fi romance explores that very question. Joel Barish decides to undergo a procedure to erase his ex-girlfriend Clementine from his memory, only to rediscover his love for her as his memories fade. The film's non-linear storytelling and surreal visuals beautifully capture the fragmented nature of memory and the enduring power of connection.

David Lynch's surreal neo-noir mystery is a dreamlike journey into the dark side of Hollywood.
